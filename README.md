# dronecaster

_cast drones for hours, send it out to your gear and `.wav` whatever beauty returns_

The lua side of house is mostly done (just need to wire up the softcutting.) I'd love to open this up to be a little community project and get enough contributions to get to a v1 release. 

I'm asking for contrubutors to help write SynthDefs that takes two parameters - `amp` and `hz` and makes a drone.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- I expect the drones to be synthesized with Supercollider.
- I expect no audio samples to be used.
- I expect the SynthDef to accept an `amp` and a `hz` parameter.
- I expect the `hz` parameter to inform the note the drone plays, but chordal smears, subtle (and not-so-subtle) detune-ages, deep LFOs, and other sonic mutilations are very welcome.
- A drone may be of original inspiration or picked from the artisanal drone below.

**Artisanal Drone Menu**
- :white_check_mark: **Sine** _The TestSine. Old faithful._
- :new: **Triangle** _Little brother to Sine._
- :new: **Square** _Big sister, opinionated on her pulsewidth, but reasonable._
- :new: **Eno** _Bandpassed, understated, airporty._
- :new: **Belong** _Thick, enveloping, shimmering._
- :new: **Hecker** _Noisey, imaginary country, suspended animation._
- :new: **Gristle** _Primal sawtooth._
- :new: **Starlids** _Symphonic, meek, radiant._
- :new: **GY!BE** _The car is on fire._
- :new: **V/Vm** _Compressed sausages of embalmed rave._
- :new: **Canada** _Scientific, detuned, dignified._
- :question: Others...
